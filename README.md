# exscalabar

This is the repository for collaborative work on the EXSCALABAR user interface.  The user interface is currently in development 
but items in the master should be functional.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is intended to provide some insight into the architecture of the UI.  The architecture roughly follows the guidelines laid out by [John Pappa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).  Each piece is wrapped in an [immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression).
